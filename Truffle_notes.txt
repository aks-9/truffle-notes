***Install Truffle after installing node.js.***


npm install -g truffle


truffle version





***INITIATING A PROJECT***


truffle init





***COMPILATION***


truffle compile


Two files will be crated in 'build' folder: 
demo.json and Migrations.json

demo.json will have 'abi' as well as 'bytecode' of the compiled contract.





***DEPLOYMENT***
In the migration folder, create a copy of the 1_migration.js file and rename it as 2_demo_migration.js. The order of deployment is according to the number in the name of the file.

Then replace the 'Migrations' word with 'demo' in the JS code.


Then go to the file 'truffle.config.js' file and find the 'networks' and uncomment the 'development' block.

change the 'port' to 7545 and keep your Ganache running in background.

then execute:


truffle migrate


no need to compile first, migrate will compile as well.








***Re-deployment***

truffle migrate --reset





***INFURA SETUP****

It's a full node to eaisly connect to the Ethereum blockchain. It helps to deploy our contract on testnet or mainnet eaisily.

Register, login and create a new project. Choose blockchain. Then you will get ENDPOINTS for the selected blockchain, which we can use to connect to the mainnet or testnet.





***CONFIGURE TRUFFLE FOR INFURA ****
Uncomment the ropsten network in 'truffle.config.js' under 'networks'

Then copy and paste your infura endpoint in provider section along with mnemonic.

uncomment this line of code:

const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');

This will connect Infura and Metamask wallet.

create a mnemonic variable.
const mnemonic = 'PASTE MNEMONIC HERE';





***DEPLOYMENT ON ROPSTEN TEST NETWORK****
 run:
  
 npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
 
 truffle migrate --network ropsten





***SMART CONTRACT INTEGRATION WITH REACT***

Goto https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/

choose REACT


create a new folder called 'frontend' in your project folder

change directory
cd frontend

truffle unbox react

This will create all the required folders for frontend.

Goto the truffle.config.js file in the newly created frontend folder.

set the port to 7545

client folder will have all the REACT.JS files.


change the solidity version of the default contracts to 0.9.0

then run:

truffle compile



We will get a contracts folder in client/src

All the abi and bytecode will be in the  json file under client folder as client needs to interact with smart contracts.

truffle migrate




***RUNNING OUR REACT APP****

cd client

npm start

This will start react app and give an error. Because our Metamask is connected with Ropsten but we connected truffle with Ganache. So we've to connect Metamask with Ganache.

Go to Metamask and add a custom RPC to the networks.

Network name: Ganache GUI
New RPC url: HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545
chain ID: 1337

import account from Ganache into Metamask.
Paste the private key of one of the accounts of Ganache and import.

Refersh the React app and it will give the Metamask popup.
